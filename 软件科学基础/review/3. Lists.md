#### Pair
```Coq
Inductive natprod : Type := 
	| pair (n1 n2 : nat).

Notation "( x , y )" := (pair x y).
```

注意区分Pair和多参数匹配


#### Lists
```Coq
Inductive natlist : Type := 
	| nil 
	| cons (n : nat) (l : natlist).

Notation "x :: l" := (cons x l) 
					(at level 60, right associativity).
Notation "[ ]" := nil. 
Notation "[ x ; .. ; y ]" := (cons x .. (cons y nil) ..).
Notation "x ++ y" := (app x y)
                     (right associativity, at level 60).


Definition hd (default : nat) (l : natlist) : nat :=
  match l with
  | nil => default
  | h :: t => h
  end.

Definition tl (l : natlist) : natlist :=
  match l with
  | nil => nil
  | h :: t => t
  end.

```


##### multiset via Lists
```Coq
Fixpoint included (s1 : bag) (s2 : bag) : bool :=

  match s1, s2 with
  | nil, _ => true
  | _, nil => false
  | h1 :: t1, h2 :: t2 => if member h1 s2 
						  then included t1 (remove_one h1 s2) 
						  else false
  end.
```


##### Reasoning About Lists
because the [[]] is substituted into the "scrutinee" (the expression whose value is being "scrutinized" by the match) in the definition of app, allowing the match itself to be simplified. 
```Coq
Theorem nil_app : forall l : natlist,
  [] ++ l = l.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
```

##### Generalizing Statements
In some situations, it can be necessary to generalize a statement in order to prove it by induction.  Intuitively, the reason is that a more general statement also yields a more general
(stronger) inductive hypothesis.  If you find yourself stuck in a proof, it may help to step back and see whether you can prove a stronger statement.
