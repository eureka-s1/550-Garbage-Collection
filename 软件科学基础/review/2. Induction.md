**Structural Induction:** 
- 对于任意递归定义的类型
- 证明P对该类型的每一个构造函数都成立
- 数学归纳法是结构归纳法在自然数上的特例

`induction n as [| n' IHn'].` 


`assert`：证明子定理，帮助rewrite定位
 
`replace`：`replace (t) with (u)`  replaces (all copies of) expression `t` in the goal by expression `u`, and generates `t = u` as an additional subgoal.

If a hypothesis has the form  `H: P -> a = b`, then `rewrite H` will
rewrite `a` to `b` in the goal, and add `P` as a new subgoal. Use that in the inductive step of this exercise. 
```Coq
// example
Theorem add_shuffle3' : forall n m p : nat,
  n + (m + p) = m + (n + p).
Proof.
  intros n m p.
  replace (n + (m + p)) with (n + m + p).
  replace (n + m) with (m + n).
  - rewrite add_assoc. reflexivity.
  - rewrite add_comm. reflexivity.
  - rewrite add_assoc. reflexivity.  Qed.
```


The [replace] tactic allows you to specify a particular subterm to

   rewrite and what you want it rewritten to: [replace (t) with (u)]

   replaces (all copies of) expression [t] in the goal by expression

   [u], and generates [t = u] as an additional subgoal. This is often

   useful when a plain [rewrite] acts on the wrong part of the goal.

```Coq
Theorem plus_leb_compat_l : forall n m p : nat,
  n <=? m = true -> (p + n) <=? (p + m) = true.
Proof.
  intros n m p H.
  induction p as [| p' IHp'].
  - (* n = 0 *)
    simpl. rewrite H. reflexivity.
  - (* n = S p' *)
    simpl. rewrite IHp'. reflexivity.  
Qed.
