### Data and Functions
#### Enumerated Types
Coq offers a powerful mechanism for defining new data types from scratch

Example: Days of the Week
```Coq
Inductive day: Type := 
	| monday 
	| tuesday 
	| wednesday 
	| thursday 
	| friday 
	| saturday 
	| sunday.

Definitionnext_weekday (d:day) : day := 
	match d with 
	| monday => tuesday 
	| tuesday => wednesday 
	| wednesday=> thursday 
	| thursday => friday 
	| friday => monday 
	| saturday => monday 
	| sunday => monday 
	end.
```

**type inference**: Coq can figure out these types for itself when they are not given explicitly

Record what we expect the result to be in the form of a Coq **example**
```Coq
Example test_next_weekday: 
	(next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.

Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
```

The key word **Example** can be replaced by **Lemma, Theorem, Fact, Remark**, etc.

#### Boolean
```Coq
Inductive bool : Tpye :=
	| true
	| false
```

We can also introduce some familiar infix syntax for the operations we have just defined. The **Notation** command defines a new symbolic notation for an existing definition.

```Coq
Notation "x && y" := (andb x y)
Notation "x || y" := (orb x y)
```

#### Types
Every expression in Coq has a type describing what sort of thing it computes.

An Inductive definition does two things:
- It defines a set of new **constructors**. E.g., red, primary, true, false, monday, etc. are **constructors**.
- It groups them into a new named type, like bool, rgb, or color.

#### Modules

#### Tuples 
A single constructor with multiple parameters can be used to create a **tuple** type.

#### Numbers
(similar to Nat in Haskell)
```coq
Inductive nat : Type :=
  | O
  | S (n : nat).
```

 **Recursion** functions are introduced with the keyword **Fixpoint** instead of Definition.
```coq
Fixpoint even (n:nat) : bool :=
	match n with
	| O        => true
	| S O      => false
	| S (S n') => even n'
	end.
```

### Proof by Simplification

`reflexivity` does somewhat more simplification than `simpl` does


### Proof by Rewriting
```Coq
Theorem plus_id_example : forall n m:nat
	n = m -> n + n = m + m
Proof.
  (* move both quantifiers into the context: *)
  intros n m.
  (* move the hypothesis into the context: *)
  intros H.
  (* rewrite the goal using the hypothesis: *)
  rewrite -> H.
  reflexivity.  Qed.
```

`intro n.`: moves n from the quantifier in the goal to a context of current assumptions. 
`rewrite -> H` : The arrow symbol in the rewrite has nothing to do with implication: it tells Coq to apply the rewrite from left to right. To rewrite from right to left, use rewrite <-.
- We can use the rewrite tactic with a previously proved theorem instead of a hypothesis from the context.

### Proof by Case Analysis
`destruct` tactic
```Coq
Theorem plus_1_neq_0 : forall n : nat,
  (n + 1) =? 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n'] eqn:E.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.   Qed.
```

The annotation `as [| n']` is called an intro pattern. It tells Coq what variable names to introduce in each subgoal.

In each subgoal, Coq remembers the assumption about n that is relevant for this subgoal. The `eqn:E` annotation tells destruct to give the name E to this equation.

The - signs on the second and third lines are called _bullets_, and they mark the parts of the proof that correspond to the subgoals.
  
Besides - and +, we can use × (asterisk) or any repetition of a bullet symbol (e.g. `--` or `***`) as a bullet. 

### Structural Recursion

Coq demands that some argument of **every** Fixpoint definition be "decreasing."
