**AComparative Survey of Open-Source Application-Class RISC-V Processor Implementations**

Evaluation Platform : FPGA of the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ family

This work concentrates on application-class RISC-V processors covering the medium to high performance range and **excludes** **lightweight** RISC-V implementations.


#### 3. implementations
This work evaluates midrange to high performance cores that satisfy the terms **application-class** and **open source**.
- **application-class** : complies to the RV64I ISA base with a word size of 64 bit and if it is ca pable to boot a UNIX-based OS
- **open source** : published under a license that allows commercial use with out imposed fees
